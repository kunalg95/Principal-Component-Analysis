# PCA to Speed-up Machine Learning Algorithms
# Implementation

1. Without PCA
2. With PCA

Iris-Dataset
-------------
Goals: Logistic regression used to check the accuracy using with/without PCA. No improvement in accuracy because of less features.

Mnist-Dataset
-------------
Goals: Logistic regression used to check the accuracy using with/without PCA. Improvement in accuracy and time-complexity after using PCA.
